But there are songs created <br> in other languages like Filipino, Korean, Irish, Chinese, Maori and many more. <br> Sometimes, music can be listened to by itself. It can be produced without voices. <br> For instance, music can be produced by using instruments like piano, <br> violin, drums or even using beats. </p>

    <h2> MUSIC RECOMMENDATIONS </h2>
    
        <!-- Paragraph of music recommendations -->
    <p> There are so many music and musicians that I recommend. There is so many <br> talented artists or musicians out there, that I’m pretty sure that you will love <br> their music as well. </p>
    
    <p> One of them that I recommend is an artist called Melanie Martinez. She is a <br> creative songwriter and singer! Her songs are so creative and has a powerful <br> meaningful message them in every song she has. My favourite song from her is <br> called ‘Mrs. Potato Head’, I really recommend listening to her songs! </p>
    
    <p> I recommend listening to music in other language. I love to listen <br> to K-pop, which is Korean Pop. I would say to listen to the groups called <br> BTS, Stray Kids,  or TXT. Their songs are very fun and nice to <br> listen. Listen to the K-pop song called ‘Runaway’ by TXT.</p>
